# SmartEVSE

ModBusRegisters.pdf lists the ModBus-RTU/RS485 registers. The SmartEVSE operates by default at 9600 BAUD (8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). Be aware that for communicating with the board, a state change (e.g. pressing the button on the board) is needed as long as the modbus address is 1.
