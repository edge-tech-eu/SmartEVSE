# SmartEVSE

ModBusRegisters.pdf lists the ModBus-RTU/RS485 registers. The SmartEVSE operates by default at 9600 BAUD (8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). Be aware that a state change (e.g. pressing the button on the board) is needed before communication is possible with the SmartEVSE with default address 1.

Note that important registers are protected by "magic" (first write the magic code, input register 0x0202) and settings are only persistent after writing them to EEPROM (input register 0x000a)
